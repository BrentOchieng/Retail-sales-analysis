II). The Asian and Pacific (APAC) market stands as the largest Distinct market for the retailer. On the other hand the company has a lot to do to bring in the Canadian Market into their influence.

III). The US Market is the most profitable for the retail giant when it comes to profits accrued. The canadian Market still lags behind in the companys product usage.

IV). The Corporate Market segment remains to be the most profitable compared to the Home office and the Consumer.

V). The US_Consumer market will be more profitable for the retail giant should they embark on working with the combined consumer market segmentation mode. Consequently the company needs to work on the best ways of bringing in the canadian consumers into their grip.
